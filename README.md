# mongo-homestead

This script helps you setup MongoDB in your Homestead machine. 

The script assumes that you already have the basic setup for Homestead, if you don't have it set up or are not sure you can follow the guide in [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead) and complete your installation.

Once installation is finished, you can access your MongoDB installation with any client such as [RoboMongo](https://robomongo.org/) through ssh.

To help you get started with Laravel and MongoDB I have been using the [laravel-mongodb](https://github.com/jenssegers/laravel-mongodb) library.   

If there are any issues or improvements to the setup script, feel free to send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/heydavid713/mongo-homestead/pulls) or open an [Issue](https://github.com/heydavid713/mongo-homestead/issues).
